Let’s take a look at all the powerful features for making an amazing lead form, survey or poll, subscription form, request a quote form, payment form, user registration form, or anything else. With Formidable, there’s no limit to what you can achieve! The possibilities are endless.

Formidable adapts to YOUR needs.

Want to run quizzes on your site? Formidable is your quiz maker with all the features you need to create and run both educational quizzes and the beloved (and addictive) BuzzFeed style quizzes.

Our team has worked hard to create the Swiss Army Knife for WordPress. Plus, we’ve made integrations that fit into your tech stack.

Check out some of our main features below:

== Drag & Drop Form Maker ==

Our form maker comes with all the powerful fields that you need to create a solution-focused form, fast!

Formidable drag and drop forms allow you to quickly build unlimited surveys, quizzes, price calculators, and whatever else you need.

== Complete Entry Management for Web Forms and Surveys ==

When a user submits a web form, it's stored in your WordPress database so you won’t lose any leads. Formidable allows you to view all your quiz and survey entries right from your WordPress dashboard (even in the free version!).

Even though the entries are saved, it's still a **GDPR-friendly** form generator. You can turn off IP tracking or stop saving submissions entirely. Or add a GDPR checkbox field to your lead forms and payment forms to collect consent.

Need to import your leads to an external service like Mailchimp? No problem. **Export leads to a CSV**, open it in Excel, or import it anywhere.

You can also configure unlimited email notifications and autoresponders triggered by submissions.

On top of that, you can easily customize the success message after a form is submitted, or redirect visitors to another page.

== The Only Form Maker Plugin with an Advanced Styler ==

With our built-in styler, you can instantly customize the look and feel of your website form. With just a few clicks, your email form can be transformed to match your website design.

By default, a single styling template is created. If you want a custom form style for each footer and sidebar form, check out the premium version of Formidable.

== Build Smart Surveys with Beautiful Reports ==

Formidable Pro includes an intuitive survey feature (like Survey Monkey, but without the high costs), so you can quickly create powerful surveys with Net Promoter Scores (NPS), Likert fields, star ratings, image radio buttons, and more.

We believe that data alone does no good if you can't analyze it. That’s why we make it easy to analyze data from a survey, quiz, or calculator. Beautiful reports will be waiting for you, or create your own customized graphs. Our graphs and reports will help you analyze and showcase data.

You can even showcase data on the front-end of your website. Just embed graphs in your WordPress posts or pages.

The best part is that you can do this all without any third-party tools.

== Quickly Create an Advanced WordPress Registration Form for Any Use Case ==

Whether you need to create a youth sports team, event, or church retreat registration, Formidable has you covered. Unlike other contact form plugins, Formidable comes with a repeater field that allows you to create the best registration forms.

Then, our marketing integrations and APIs can send the data anywhere you want.

== Accept Credit Cards and Easily Collect Payments ==

By now, you probably already realize the theme that Formidable is more than just a WordPress contact form plugin. You can use it to create a payment form and accept credit card payments right from your website.

We offer seamless integration with PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net, so you can create an order form, donation form, or purchase form.

You can even create a WooCommerce form with custom fields.

== Make Data-Driven Web Applications with a Formidable View ==

Formidable Views are by far the most powerful feature that makes Formidable far more than just a contact form plugin. Views allow you to flexibly display any submitted data on the front-end of your website.

Our customers use Formidable Views to create data-driven web apps. We see real estate listings, employment listings, event calendars, business or member directories, job boards, and other searchable databases.

As you can see, Formidable is not your average contact form plugin. It's a true all-in-one WordPress form solution.

== Increase Sales with WooCommerce Product Order Forms ==

Formidable is the only WordPress form builder plugin that offers extensive integration with WooCommerce orders.

Our goal is to empower you to build powerful WooCommerce product order forms, so you can increase your store sales.

You can create a WooCommerce form to use as a WooCommerce product configurator with custom calculation fields. Then automatically send the order form info to the WooCommerce cart with variable pricing options.

== Make Powerful Quiz Forms & Calculators ==

In addition to a simple order form, you can also create quizzes or web calculators.

More on quizzes later, but here are some example online calculators that you can quickly add to your WordPress site:

* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/advanced-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Advanced Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/simple-mortgage-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Basic Mortgage Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/automobile-payment-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Car Payment Calculator</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/nps-survey-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">Net Promoter Score (NPS) Survey</a>
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/bmi-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">BMI Calculator</a> and more Health and Fitness Calculators
* <a href="https://formidableforms.com/form-templates/age-calculator-form/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion">User Age Calculator</a>
* Online Quote Calculator
* Finance Calculator
* Booking Cost Calculator
* Product Price Calculator

... and our powerful calculated fields allow you to build just about anything.

You can also create a poll, or survey on your WordPress site and display the results. This is great for membership sites, LMS, or just for viral quizzes to grow your email list.

Now you can create custom form-based solutions without any code.

== Create a WordPress User Registration Form, Profile Form, and More ==

If you run a WordPress membership site, then you need a form plugin that allows you to customize your WordPress user registration form and collect data with a user profile.

With our front-end editing, you can build a custom profile form for users to keep their profile up to date. You can even progressively add to the profile from a set of forms. Everything from the first lead form to the last payment form can extend the user profile. Once logged in, all new submissions in a quiz, or support form can be linked to that user account.

You will not find any other WordPress form plugin offering a front-end editing solution with the same level of extendability.

== All the Advanced Fields & Features You Need to Grow Your Business ==

Formidable goes far above and beyond with features like multi-page forms, save and continue, cascading form fields, and powerful conditional logic. Then add partial submissions, invisible spam protection, front-end user post submission, calculated fields, user flow, quizzes, and so much more. Additionally, our Payment fields will help you create a donation form, booking form, credit card form, or other payment form.

We're on a mission to offer all-in-one solution-focused forms. This way you don't have to install 5 plugins alongside your form maker to do everything you want.

== Extend & Customize - A Developer's Dream Come True ==

Formidable is the solution of choice for smart developers, freelancers, and agencies. It helps you build complex solutions and simple forms quickly to defy the limits imposed by time and knowledge.

Our goal is to help you build complex websites with low overhead. That's why we made Formidable the most extendable WordPress form plugin on the market. We want to make it possible for anyone to defy gravity and build anything.

A Formidable View allows you to display data anywhere, so you can quickly create data-driven web apps.

On top of that, our hooks and filters allow you to extend Formidable to meet your most advanced needs. We even include hundreds of code examples in our docs to give you the confidence to get started.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I get started with the best forms for WordPress? =
The fastest way to build a form is to use the example we built for you. After you activate Formidable, insert [formidable id=contact-form] on the WordPress page of your choice.

Go to the Formidable page and click "add new". Choose the Contact Us form template or another free template and click "Create".

Next, edit or create a WordPress contact page. Click the "Formidable" button to open the shortcode generator. Choose your new Stripe form, quiz, or web form and insert it into the WordPress page. Save the page for a beautiful WP contact form, ready to collect and store your leads. The contact form template will get you up and running fast.

= Why isn't WordPress sending emails? =
When you do not receive emails, try the following steps:

   1. Double check the email address in your Email action on the settings page. The [admin_email] shortcode uses the email address from your WordPress Settings -> General page.
   2. Are you receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)? If not, notifications will not work either.
   3. Check your SPAM box.
   4. Try a different address in your settings.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar emailing alternative and configure the SMTP settings.
   6. If these steps don't fix the problem and other WP signup emails are not going out, please reach out to your web host.

= 6.4 =
* New: A floating button has been added to some admin pages with links for documentation and support.
* New: When importing, if a matching trashed form is found based on a key match, it will be deleted before the import begins. This prevents conflicts that cause field shortcodes and conditional logic not to update as expected when imported.
* New: The field search has been improved. Inactive fields will no longer appear when there is no match, and categories will no longer appear when no children fields are visible.
* New: Captcha key settings will now be trimmed on save to avoid unecessary whitespace characters reported to cause issues in some cases.
* New: Form previews inside of Gutenberg blocks are no longer interactive and can no longer be submitted when clicking the submit button in the preview.

* Fix: Added an extra check so invalid serialized data doesn't trigger any warning or errors when an unexpected array key type is found.
* Fix: XML exports would fail to import because of an unexpected carriage return at the beginning of the file, or an unexpected meta tag added by the Equity WordPress theme. In these cases the XML string will now be corrected in order for the import to work.
* Fix: Added a callable check to avoid a "Call to undefined function FrmProAddonsController::print_grace" error when upgrading.

* Fix: A redirect confirmation action with an empty redirect URL would exit early and fallback to using a message without checking the frm_redirect_url filter first for redirects set in custom code.
